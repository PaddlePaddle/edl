# Purpose
This article illustrates how to run distill demo on Kubernetes cluster or one single machine.

## On Kubernetes

We have built the docker images for you and you can start a demo on Kubernetes immediately:

1. Get the yaml files from: `edl/example/distill/k8s/`
2. Use kubectl to create resources from them, such as `kubectl create -f student.yaml`  

## On a single node
